This repository contained a CSS injection that replaced the entire site with a trollface and prevented the user from doong anything. The injection was quickly fixed by GitHub, below is the original readme text for archival purposes. **There's a high chance that it'll still work on other MathJax-enabled sites.**

You can see what it used to look like on the Web Archive:
